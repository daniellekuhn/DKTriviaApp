# Welcome to Danielle's Trivia App! <img src="https://i1.wp.com/freepngimages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ginger-cat-lazing.png?fit=616%2C650" width="80px">
I independently built a full-stack trivia application, compatible with iOS, Android, and web browser for friends and family to play while in quarantine! I used React Native for the frontend and Firebase for the backend. 

Current trivia questions include multiple-choice Geography and Computer questions!

# User Stories
I implemented the following user stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to use the app on my browser or mobile phone
- As a user, I want to input my username to post my score on the scoreboard
- As a user, I want to be able to select different trivia question categories 
- As a user, I want to receive randomly generated trivia questions and not the same ones
- As a user, I want the order of correct and incorrect answers randomized
- As a user, I don't want to be able to change my answer after I submit it
- As a user, I want to know the correct answer after answering
- As a user, I want to see my live score each round
- As a user, I want to be able to leave the game and return to the landing page
- As a user, I want to be able to view the scoreboard

# Stack
I used the following tech stack to build my application:
<table>
  <tr>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">Front-end</td>
    <td align="center">Back-end</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/React-icon.svg/1280px-React-icon.svg.png" alt="React" title="React" width="80px"/></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="https://firebase.google.com/images/brand-guidelines/logo-built_white.png" alt="Firebase" title="Firebase" width="80px"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>

I also used axios to get trivia questions from a public trivia API (https://opentdb.com).
