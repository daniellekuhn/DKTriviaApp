# Welcome to Danielle's Trivia App! <img src="https://i1.wp.com/freepngimages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ginger-cat-lazing.png?fit=616%2C650" width="80px">
I built a full-stack trivia application that's compatible with iOS, Android, and web browser for friends and family to play while in quarantine! I used React Native for the frontend and Firebase for the backend. 

Current trivia questions include multiple-choice Geography and Computer questions!

# User Stories
I implemented the following user stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to use the app on my browser or mobile phone
- As a user, I want to input my username to post my score on the scoreboard
- As a user, I want to be able to select different trivia question categories 
- As a user, I want to receive randomly generated trivia questions and not the same ones
- As a user, I want the order of correct and incorrect answers randomized
- As a user, I don't want to be able to change my answer after I submit it
- As a user, I want to know the correct answer after answering
- As a user, I want to see my live score each round
- As a user, I want to be able to leave the game and return to the landing page
- As a user, I want to be able to view the scoreboard
